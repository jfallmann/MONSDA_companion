# MONSDA_companion

Repository for config files of published results derived from [MONSDA](https://github.com/jfallmann/MONSDA).  

Sub-directories should be named after the Project with a meaningful ID. 
Each sub-directory holds a README file with links to the datasets (unless SRA and FETCH is used in the config) and reference and annotation files (or the files if small enough), a short description of the project and the corresponding config file used for analysis.

PRs always welcome
