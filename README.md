# MONSDA_companion

Repository for config files of published results derived from [MONSDA](https://github.com/jfallmann/MONSDA).  

Directories resemble the version of MONSDA that was used to generate results.  

Sub-directories list the doi of the publication as soon as available. 
Each sub-directory holds a file with links to the datasets, a description of the project and the corresponding config file used for analysis.
